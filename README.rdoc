== TowSmith

== This is our capstone project for DevPoint Labs (Grad. Feb 5th). Our group members are Rey Holmgren, Arielle Dye, Scott Ball, and Natasha Mays.

The goal of our app is to provide a simple way to connect Locksmiths and Tow Drivers to people who are in need of them. Also, our app will allow the customer to pick a provider based upon reviews, location, and standard rates for distance.
